<h2>Girl Group</h2>
<p>
  A girl group is a music act featuring several female singers who generally harmonize together.
  The term "girl group" is also used in a narrower sense in the United States to denote the wave of American female pop music singing groups,
  many of whom were influenced by doo-wop and which flourished in the late 1950s and early 1960s between the decline of early rock and roll and start of the British Invasion.
  All-female bands, in which members also play instruments, are usually considered a separate phenomenon. These groups are sometimes called "girl bands" to differentiate,
  although this terminology is not universally followed.
